### Keras implementatations of unet and style transfers

We Will be Looking at testing the usage of pose transformation and pose extraction out of pictures. with the help of Vunet:
https://github.com/CompVis/vunet
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf //the cited paper on unets used in vunet 

https://ml5js.org/docs/style-transfer-image-example  //Idea for somting to do with vunet have it transfrom a picture you give it to a pose in the browser or in a app.  Even better if you can edit the pose live.

https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet  //an example of live pose detection it does not do transformations though
